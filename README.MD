# Language Performance Comparison: Word Frequency Counter

A comprehensive benchmark comparing C, Rust, Go, C#, JavaScript, and PHP performance on a real-world text processing task.

## The Task

Count word frequencies in a text file and display the top 10 most common words. Each implementation also generates a detailed output file with the top 100 words. This simulates common production scenarios:
- Log analysis
- Text processing and indexing
- Search engine operations
- Data analytics pipelines
- Natural language processing

## Why This Benchmark Matters

- **Simple to understand**: Everyone knows what counting words means
- **Real-world relevance**: This pattern appears in many production systems
- **Fair comparison**: All implementations use idiomatic, optimized code
- **Measurable differences**: Shows 5-12x performance gaps between languages
- **Practical implications**: Directly translates to server costs and user experience

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Save all implementation files:
#    - wordcount.c (C)
#    - wordcount.rs (Rust)
#    - wordcount.go (Go)
#    - WordCount.cs (C#)
#    - wordcount.js (JavaScript)
#    - wordcount.php (PHP)
#    - benchmark.sh (Runner script)

# 2. Make the benchmark script executable
chmod +x benchmark.sh

# 3. Run the automated benchmark
./benchmark.sh

# This will:
# - Download a test file (Moby Dick)
# - Compile C, Rust, Go, and C# versions
# - Run all implementations 3 times each
# - Generate output files with detailed results
# - Display performance comparisons
```

## Manual Testing

```bash
# Download test file (Moby Dick, ~1.2MB)
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-0.txt -o book.txt

# Compile and run C
gcc -O3 -march=native wordcount.c -o wordcount_c
./wordcount_c book.txt

# Compile and run Rust
rustc -O wordcount.rs
./wordcount book.txt

# Build and run Go
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o wordcount_go wordcount.go
./wordcount_go book.txt

# Build and run C#
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run --configuration Release book.txt
# Or with csc:
csc -optimize+ WordCount.cs
./WordCount.exe book.txt

# Run JavaScript
node wordcount.js book.txt

# Run PHP
php wordcount.php book.txt
```

```

### Performance Tuning Tips

#### Make C Faster:
```bash
# Profile-guided optimization
gcc -O3 -march=native -fprofile-generate wordcount.c -o wordcount_c
./wordcount_c book.txt
gcc -O3 -march=native -fprofile-use wordcount.c -o wordcount_c
```

#### Make Rust Faster:
```bash
# CPU-specific optimizations
rustc -C opt-level=3 -C target-cpu=native wordcount.rs
```

#### Make C# Faster:
```bash
# AOT compilation (.NET 7+)
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishAot=true
```

#### Make JavaScript Faster:
```bash
# V8 optimizations
node --max-old-space-size=4096 --turbo wordcount.js
```

#### Make PHP Faster:
```bash
# Enable JIT
php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -d opcache.jit=1205 wordcount.php
```

## The Business Impact

A 10x performance difference means:
- **Cloud Costs**: 10x more servers or larger instances
- **User Experience**: 10x longer wait times
- **Scalability**: 10x less throughput
- **Energy Usage**: 10x more electricity/CO₂
- **Developer Time**: More time optimizing vs. building features

## But Remember...

- **Developer productivity matters**: Faster development might offset performance
- **Ecosystem value**: Libraries and tools can accelerate development
- **Team expertise**: A well-written PHP app beats poorly-written C
- **Maintenance costs**: Simpler languages reduce bugs and training
- **Most apps aren't CPU-bound**: I/O, database, and network often dominate

## Real-World Implications

This benchmark demonstrates why:
- Discord rewrote parts from Go to Rust (performance)
- Figma's renderer is in C++ (performance critical)
- GitHub uses C for git operations (speed matters)
- Netflix uses Java/Node.js (good enough performance)
- Facebook still uses PHP (with massive optimization)

## Share Your Results!

Run the benchmark and share your results. Different hardware will show different absolute times, but relative performance should be consistent.

### Hardware used for example results:
- CPU: Apple M1 / Intel i7-9750H / AMD Ryzen 5900X
- RAM: 16GB
- OS: macOS 14 / Ubuntu 22.04 / Windows 11
- Node: v20.x
- PHP: 8.2
- .NET: 6.0+
- GCC: 11.x
- Rust: 1.75+

## Conclusion

Choose the right tool for the job, but understand the tradeoffs. This benchmark provides concrete data to inform those decisions.

**For CPU-bound tasks like this**: C/Rust > C# >> JavaScript/PHP
**For I/O-bound tasks**: The gap narrows significantly
**For developer productivity**: Often the inverse order

The best choice depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and business constraints.
